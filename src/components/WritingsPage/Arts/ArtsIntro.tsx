        Hugh wrote many catalogue essays when Director of the Ikon Gallery and
        continued to write about art when he could. By the early 1990's he had
        moved to London and was able to get to more exhibitions, and
        re-established contact with artists he'd known from before. Between
        about 1997 and 2002 he wrote reviews for various magazines, his main
        outlet being <span className="italic">Contemporary Visual Arts</span>,
        then a bi-monthly under the editorship of Keith Patrick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hugh wrote some thirty reviews of between 500 and 1000 words, mainly on
        solo shows by British artists, and some ten articles based on
        interviews.
